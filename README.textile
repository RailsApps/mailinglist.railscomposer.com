The application is running on Heroku at "mailinglist.railscomposer.com":http://mailinglist.railscomposer.com/.

Visitors can submit a form to add their email address to the Rails Composer mailing list.

h4. Mailing List

The Rails Composer mailing list is hosted on "MailChimp":http://mailchimp.com/. The mailing list is used for occasional announcements from the RailsApps project.

This application connects to MailChimp's API using the "Gibbon":https://github.com/amro/gibbon gem.

h4. Queueing with Active Job

The application uses the "Active Job":https://github.com/rails/activejob gem and the "SuckerPunch":https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch gem for job queueing so the user experiences no delays when submitting the form or using the API.

Rails Composer is a tool that generates Rails starter applications. When developers use Rails Composer, they are invited to join the mailing list:
